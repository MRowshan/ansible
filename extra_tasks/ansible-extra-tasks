Python Server: -
 Users:
o Create new user called python with a custom password.
o This user&#39;s password should be saved in a vars file on the control machine and
referenced by the playbook.

 Git:
o Latest version should be installed on client machine.
o Clone/pull python server repo.
o Configure git user.
  Server:
o Installed in ~/python_server.
o Server should be running.
o Service should be bounced if the code has changed.
 Playbooks:
o Idempotent.
o Platform-independent.
o Should be 1 playbook per section (so 1 for user, 1 for git, etc) and these should
be referenced from a main.yml.

 Stretch goals:
o Automate playbook to run at midnight.
o Encrypt passwords using Ansible Vault.
o Convert playbooks to roles.
o Use web hooks to automate the playbook to run whenever the repo is updated.



Notes:
Switched python server for go server
